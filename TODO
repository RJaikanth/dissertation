ASPSet (1 week)
---------------
1. Extract 2D coordinates (Done for a single image).
2. Check correctness of 2D coordinates (Done).
3. Extract image with bounding box for better visibility and scale.
4. Convert to YOLO-Friendly format (COCO).
5. Upload to kaggle.
6. Finetune YOLO on dataset.
7. Validate.

SportsPose (2 days)
-------------------
1. Use custom YOLO to extract 2D coordinates.


Elevation (2 days)
------------------
1. Train a simple feed forward network to elevate 2D to 3D points (Brute force learning).
2. Validate and test


Comparison (3-4 days)
---------------------
1. Use a messi free-kick video to check as base.
2. Use DTW to compare the 2 sets of skeletal data.
