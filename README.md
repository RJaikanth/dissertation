## Abstract

The recent Coronavirus pandemic and consequent lock downs across the world has disrupted
teaching methods, with classes shifting from classrooms to online classes using calling services.
This project presents an approach to utilise Human Pose Estimation (HPE), a classical branch
of Computer Vision, to aid and enhance sports coaching. Advancements in highly performant
hardware systems and the adjoining software have led to faster and more accurate algorithms
for Human Pose Estimation. These advancements have facilitated researchers and engineers to
employ Human Pose Estimation in various different scenarios, including Sports Coaching. This
project explores the potential application of HPE for the training of soccer deadball techniques
\- Free kicks and penalty kicks. The project leverages two large datasets of sports-specific
movements in the form of video data. We fine-tuned existing architectures on these datasets
to cater to the dynamic and fast-paced nature of athletics. The evaluation on the dataset
demonstrates that fine-tuning models provides precise and reliable body joint localisation even
in fast-paced and cluttered environments. Additionally, two novel architectures are proposed
and trained to elevate the 2D pose keypoints to the 3D space to remove dependency on the
viewpoint of the camera. These keypoints are compared with a baseline video of the technique
to score the users' technique. This is done by treating the samples as a time series and using
methods for comparing time series data such as Dynamic TimeWarping. Further, the potential
challenges and limitations of HPE in sports coaching is discussed, offering insights into areas
for further improvement and research.
